## The Jupyter Notebook Interface

When a new notebook opens, you will see the Jupter Notebook interface. Accross the top of the notebook will the the Jupyter icon and the Notebook name. You can click in the notebook name field and change the name of the notebook. Note that the file extension ```.ipynb``` is not printed in the file name field, but if you look in the Home tab, you will see that the notebook is saved with the ```.ipynb``` extension.
### Menus and Buttons

A jupyter notebook is comprised of a bunch of cells which are arrayed one after another in boxes below the menu items and buttons. There are two main types of cells: Markdown cells and Code cells.
### Code Cells

In code cells you can type Python Code and see the output. An example of a code cell is shown below. Note that the code cell has an the text ```In[ ]``` to the left of it. 

To run the code in a code cell push the [Run] button or type [Shift]+[Enter]
###  Markdown Cells

In markdown cells you can type text and headings. Markdown cells are used for documentation and explaining your code. The text in a markdown cell is not executed. Markdown cells can be formatted with a few special characters

#### Headings

```
# H1 Heading
```

```
## H2 Heading
```

```
### H3 Heading
```

```
#### H4 Heading
```

#### Code Blocks
 
For inline code blocks use the \` left quote character, the character to the left of the number 1 and above tab on most keyboards.
 
 
This is inline code:  \` \` \` Inline code block \` \` \` within a paragraph
 
For seperate code blocks use three \` left quote characters on one line, followed by the code block on seperate lines. Terminate the seperate code block with a line of three \` left quote characters.
 
\`\`\`

Seperated code blocks

\`\`\`

#### Bold and italics

**Bold** and _italic font_ is diplayed by surrounding text with a double asterisk for ```**bold**``` and a single underscore for ```_italics_```


```**bold**``` produces **bold**

```_italics_``` produces _italics_

```**_bold and italic_**``` produces **_bold and italic_**

#### Tables

Tables are displayed using the pipe ```|``` character, which is [Shift]+[\\] on most keyboards. Columns are seperated by pipes and rows are seperated by lines. After the header row, a row of pipes and dashes are needed to define the table.

```
| header1 | header 2 | header 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |
| col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |
```

produces:

| header1 | header 2 | header 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |
| col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |

#### Bullet Points and Lists

Bullet points are produced using the asterisk character ```*```

```
 * item 1
 * item 2
 * item 3
```

produces

 * item 1
 * item 2
 
Numbered lists are produced using sequential numbers followed by a dot. Indent sub-items with two spaces.

```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
  1. sub item
  2. sub item
    1. sub-sub item
    2. sub-sub item
```

produces

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
  1. sub item
  2. sub item
    1. sub-sub item
    2. sub-sub item

#### Horizontal Rule

A horizontal rule is specified with three asterisks on a single line.

```
***
```

produces

***

#### Links

Hyperlinks are specified using a set of square brackets ```[ ]``` followed by pair of parenthesis ```( )``` The text inside the square brackets will be the link, the link address goes in the parenthesis

```
[link to docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)
```

produces

[link to docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)

#### Images

Images are embedded in Jupyter Notebook markdown using the exclaimation point and square brackets ```![ ]```, followed by the image file path in parenthesis ```( )```. If the image can not be displayed, the text in square brackets will be shown. The image can be in the same directory as the notebook, or a relative path can be specified. In this case the image ```engineering.png``` is stored in the images directory, which is a subdirectory of the directory the notebook is saved in.

```
![Python Logo](images/engineering.png)
```

produces

![Python Logo](images/engineering.png)

#### LaTeX Math

LaTeX Math equations and symbols are rendered by markdown cells. A more extensive list of LaTeX commands can be found in the appendix.

```
$$ \int_{a}^{b} \frac{1}{x^2} dx $$
```

produces

$$ \int_{a}^{b} \frac{1}{x^2} dx $$

#### html

Because jupyter notebooks are rendered by web browsers, just about any html tag can be included in the markdown portion of a notebook. An example is the ```<sup>``` ```</sup>``` tags that surround super script text

```
x<sup>2</sup>
```

produces

x<sup>2</sup>

Text can be colored using html ```<font>``` ```</font>``` tags

```
<font color=red>Red Text</font>
```

produces

<font color=red>Red Text</font>

#### warning boxes

bootstrap style warning boxes can be included in jupyter notebook markdown using ```<div>``` tags

```
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <strong>Warning!</strong> Python lists start at 0
</div>
```

produces

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <strong>Warning!</strong> Python lists start at 0
</div>
### Saving Jupyter Notebooks in Other Formats

Jupyter notebooks can be saved in other formats besides the native ```.ipynb``` format. These formats can be acceed on the [File] --> [Download As] menu.

![Jupyter Notebook Export Optinos](images/jupyter_notebook_export_options.png)

The available file types are:

 * Notebook (.ipynb) - The native jupyter notebook format
 * Python (.py) - The native Python code file type.
 * HTML (.html) - A web page
 * Markdown (.md) - Markdown format
 * reST (.rst) - Restructured text format
 * LaTeX (.tex) - LaTeX Artile format
 * PDF via LaTeX - a pdf exported from LeTeX, requires a converter
 
When a Notebook is saved as a ```.py``` file, any text in Mardown Cells are converted to commments, and any code cells are kept as Python code. 

![Markdown Cells as Comments](images/jupyter_notebook_markdown_cells_as_comments.png)

The ```.py``` file after this notebook is ```Downloaded as``` a ```Python(.py)``` looks like:
