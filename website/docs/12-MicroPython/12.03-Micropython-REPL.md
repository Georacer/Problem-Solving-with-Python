## MicroPython REPL
The last section detailed the installation of MicroPython on an Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 microcontroller using Python and a package called **esptool**. In this section, you will learn how to write commands to the MicroPython REPL (the Micropython prompt) to turn an LED on and off.

Before you can use the MicroPython REPL (the MicroPython prompt) running on the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266, MicroPython needs to be installed on the board and PuTTY needs to be installed the Windows 10 computer to communicate with the board over serial. The previous section detailed how to install MicroPython on an ESP8266 microcontroller and how to install [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) on a Windows 10 machine.
### Summary of Steps
1. Connect the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 using a USB cable
2. Determine which COM port the board is connected to using the Windows Device Manager 
3. Open PuTTY and connect to the board at 115200 baud
4. Run commands at the prompt to turn the built-in LED on the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 on and off
### Connect the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 board to the laptop
Use a microUSB cable to connect the microcontroller to the computer. Make sure that the microUSB cable is a full USB data cable and not just a simple power cable. Cables that are just used to charge phones may only be power cables and may not be capable of transmitting data.
### Determine which serial port the Feather Huzzah is connected to
Use Windows Device Manager to determine which serial port the Feather Huzzah is connected to. O Windows 10, the microcontroller usually comes up as ```COM4```. You can find the serial port by looking in the Ports (COM & LPT) category of the Windows Device Manager. Look for something like **Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COM4)** in the **Ports (COM & LPT)** menu. It is the **COM#** that you are looking for.

### Use Putty to connect to the Feather Huzzah
Ensure the Feather Huzzah board is connected with a USB cable, then connect to it with PuTTY using the proper serial port (COM#) and 115200 baud. Remember to use the **Serial** radio button under **Connection Type:** to select serial communication or you will be trying to communicate with the Feather Huzzah over SSH which won't work.

This will bring up the MicroPython REPL prompt ```>>>```. If you can't see the ```>>>``` prompt, try typing [Enter], [Ctrl]-[D], pushing the RESET button on the microcontroller or unplugging then replugging the USB cable.

### Run commands at the prompt to turn the built-in LED on the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 on and off
At the MicroPython REPL (the MicroPython command prompt ```>>>```) try the following commands:

```text
>>> print('MicroPython for Engineers!')
MicroPython for Engineers
```

If we import the ```sys``` module, we can see the MicroPython implementation and platform. 

```text
>>> import sys
>>> sys.implementation
(name='micropython', version=(1, 9, 3))
>>> sys.platform
'esp8266'
```

If you see similar output, that means MicroPython is working on the Feather Huzzah. We can also view the flash memory size of our Feather Huzzah and the size of the MicroPython firmware we installed. Try this at the MicroPython prompt:

```text
>>> import port_diag
```

![Results of running import port_diag at the MicroPython REPL prompt](images/import_port_diag.PNG)

We can see the flash memory size is 4 MB. Below the label ```Firmware checksum:``` we can see a line for ```size: 600872```. This means the size of our Micropythpon installation is about 600 KB or 0.6 MB. Just over half a megabyte and we are running a working version of Python!

Now let's turn the Feather Huzzah's built-in LED on and off. The Feather Huzzah has a built-in red LED connected to Pin 0. We can access this LED with MicroPython's ```machine``` module. 

First, we use the ```machine``` module to create a ```Pin``` object. The first argument when we instantiate the ```Pin``` object is the pin number on the board (in this case ```0```). Pin 0 on the Feather Huzzah is connected to the built-in red LED. The second argument is the pin type. We want Pin 0 to act as an output pin (```machine.Pin.OUT```). We are going to assign our ```pin``` the attribute ```.on()``` or ```.off()```. This will cause the Feather board to output a positive voltage or no voltage to Pin 0 to turn the built-in red LED on and off. You can also connect Pin 0 to an external LED through a resistor then to ground and have this external LED turn on and off.

```text
>>> import machine
>>> pin = machine.Pin(0, machine.Pin.OUT)
```

Note that Pin 0 on the Adafruit Feather Huzzah is kind of wired "backwards". We call ```pin.off()``` and the built-in LED turns **on** and call ```pin.on()``` and the built-in LED turns **off**.  

```text
>>> pin.on()
>>> pin.off()
>>> pin.on()
>>> pin.off()
```

Now let's see if we can make the LED blink. We'll do this with a simple ```for``` loop. At the MicroPython REPL, initiating a loop will automatically indent the next line, so a tab is not needed before the ```pin.on()``` statement. To run the loop, type backspace on an empty line (to backspace from an indented line) and hit [Enter].

```text
>>> import time
>>> for i in range(10):
...     pin.on()
...     time.sleep(1)
...     pin.off()
...     time.sleep(1)
...
```

This will blink the LED on and off for a total of 20 seconds.
