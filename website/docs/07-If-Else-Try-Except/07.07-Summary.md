## Summary
Selection structures in Python include ```if```, ```elif```, ```else```, ```try``` and ```except```. These selection structures allow certain blocks of code to run or not run based on logical conditions. Logical conditions are expressions or variables that can be evaluated as ```True``` or ```False```.  You learned that Python uses indentation segment code after ```if```, ```elif```, and ```else``` statements. The standard indentation in Python is four spaces.

The difference between syntax errors and exception errors was demonstrated in this chapter. ```try```/```except``` blocks only check for exception errors. 

At the end of the chapter, you learned how to use flowcharts to describe the flow of a program with four basic shapes and arrows.
