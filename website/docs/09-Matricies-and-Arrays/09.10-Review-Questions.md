#### Meshgrids
Q09.40 Create two 2D arrays from the two 1D arrays below using NumPy's ```np.meshgrid()``` function. 

```text

x = [0.0, 0.1., 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]

y = [0, 2, 4, 6]
```

Q09.41 Create a meshgrid of the two arrays below:

```text

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Use element-wise multiplication to multiple each element in one of the resulting 2D arrays with the other resulting 2D array to build a multiplication table.
#### Array Operations

Q09.50 Create the two arrays below and perform each calculation.

a = [2 4 6]

b = [-1 0 1]

(a) $a + b$

(b) $1.5a -2b$

(c) $0.5ab$

(d) $\frac{b^2}{a}$


Q09.51 Create an array of angles between 0 and 2$\pi$ radians in increments of $\pi/2 radians$.

(a) Calculate the sine of each angle in the array

(b) Calculate the cosine of each angle in the array

(c) Convert each angle in the array to degrees

Q09.52 Create the two arrays below and then perform the following operations.

F1 = [-1, 0, 2]

F2 = [5, -2, 0]

(a) Calculate the dot product of F1 and F2

(b) Calculate cross product of F1 and F2

(c) Calculate the element-wise product (element-wise multiplication of F1 and F2)
#### Linear Algebra
Q09.70 Use the system of linear equations below to calculate the values of $x$ and $y$.

$$ 4x - 2y = -42 $$

$$ -6x + y = 31 $$

Q09.70 Use the system of linear equations below to calculate the values of $x$, $y$ and $z$.

$$ \frac{x}{2} +2y - z = 5 $$

$$ x + 3y - 4z = -1 $$

$$ -x - 3y + 2z = -5 $$
