## String Operations
Strings are sequences of letters, numbers, punctuation, and spaces. Strings are defined at the Python REPL by enclosing letters, numbers, punctuation, and spaces in single quotes ```' '``` or double quotes ```" "```. 

```python
>>> word = "Solution"
>>> another_word = "another solution"
>>> third_word = "3rd solution!"
```

In Python, some operations we can do on strings include concatenation (combining strings), logical comparisons (comparing strings) and indexing (pulling specific characters out of strings).
### String Concatenation
Strings can be _concatenated_ or combined using the ```+``` operator.

```python
>>> word = "Solution"
>>> another_word = "another solution"
>>> third_word = "3rd solution!"
>>> all_words = word+another_word+third_word
>>> all_words
'Solutionanother solution3rd solution!'
```

To include spaces in the concatenated string, add a string which just contains one space ```" "``` in between each string you combine.

```python
>>> word = "Solution"
>>> another_word = "another solution"
>>> third_word = "3rd solution!"
>>> all_words = word + " " + another_word + " " + third_word
>>> all_words
'Solution another solution 3rd solution!'
```
### String Comparison
Strings can be compared using the comparison operator; the double equals sign ```==```. Note the comparison operator (double equals ```==```) is not the same as the assignment operator, a single equals sign ```=```.

```python
>>> name1 = 'Gabby'
>>> name2 = 'Gabby'
>>> name1 == name2
True
```

```python
>>> name1 = 'Gabby'
>>> name2 = 'Maelle'
>>> name1 == name2
False
```

Capital letters and lower case letters are different characters in Python. A string with the same letters, but different capitalization are not equivalent.

```python
>>> name1 = 'Gabby'
>>> name2 = 'gabby'
>>> name1 == name2
False
```
### String Indexing

String indexing is the process of pulling out specific characters from a string in a particular order. In Python, strings are indexed using square brackets ```[ ]```. An important point to remember: **Python counting starts at ```0``` and ends at ```n-1```**. 

Consider the word below.

```text
Solution
```

The letter ```S``` is at the zero index, the letter ```o``` is at the first index. The last letter of the word ```Solution``` is ```n```. ```n``` is in the seventh index. Even though the word ```Solution``` has eight letters, the last letter is in the seventh index. This is because Python indexing at ```0``` and ends at ```n-1```.

```python
>>> word = 'Solution'
>>> word[0]
'S'
```
```python
>>> word[1]
'o'
```
```python
>>> word[7]
'n'
```
If the eighth index of the word ```Solution``` is called, an error is returned.

```python
>>> word[8]

IndexError: string index out of range
```
#### Negative Indexing


Placing a negative number inside of the square brackets pulls a character out of a string starting from the end of the string.

```python
>>> word[-1]
'n'
```

```python
>>> word[-2]
'o'
```

### String Slicing

A colon on the inside of the square brackets between two numbers indicates _through_. If the index ```[0:3]``` is called, the characters at positions ```0``` through ```3``` are returned. Remember Python counting starts at ```0``` and ends at ```n-1```. So ```[0:3]``` indicates the first through third letters, which are indexes ```0``` to ```2```.

```python
>>> word[0:3]
'Sol'
```
A colon by itself on the inside of square brackets indicates _all_.

```python
>>> word[:]
'Solution'
```
When three numbers are separated by two colons inside of square brackets, the numbers represent _start_ : _stop_ : _step_. But remember that Python counting starts at ```0``` and ends at ```n-1```. 

```python
>>> word[0:7:2]  #start:stop:step
'Slto'
```
When two colons are used inside of square brackets, and less than three numbers are specified, the missing numbers are set to their "defaults". The default start is ```0```, the default stop is ```n-1```, and the default step is ```1```. 

The two code lines below produce the same output since ```0``` is the default start and ```7``` (n-1) is the default stop. Both lines of code use a step of ```2```.

```python
>>> word[0:7:2]
'Slto'
```

```python
>>> word[::2]
'Slto'
```

The characters that make up a string can be reversed by using the default start and stop values and specifying a step of ```-1```.

```python
>>> word[::-1]
'noituloS'
```
