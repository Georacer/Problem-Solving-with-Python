Q02.34 The U.S. Forest service can use trigonometry to find the height of trees. The height of a tree, $h$ is equal to the distance $d$ between an observer and the base of the tree multiplied by the tangent of the angle $\theta$ between looking straight along the ground and looking up at the top of tree according to the formula:

$$ h = d\tan(\theta) $$

If a Forest Service ranger is 20 feet away from the base of a douglas fir tree and looks up at a 63 degree angle relative to straight ahead to see the top of the tree, what is the height of the douglas fir tree?

Q02.35 The tangent of an angle is equal to the sine of the angle divided by the cosine of the angle. Make two calculations, one for the tangent of -29 degrees and another calculation for the sine of -29 degrees divided by the cosine of -29 degrees. Do you observe the output of both calculations to be the same?

Q02.36 A simple model of water level based on tides (assuming high tide is at midnight) is:

$$ h = (4.8)\sin(\pi/6)(t+3)+5.1 $$

Where $h$ is the water height and $t$ is the number of hours since midnight. Using this model, calculate the water level $h$  at 6am ($t=6$ hours since midnight).

Q02.37 The x-component of a force $F_x$ is equal to the magnitude of the force $|\vec{F}|$ multiplied by the cosine of the angle $\theta$ of the force relative to the positive x-axis. 

$$ F_x = |\vec{F}|\cos(\theta) $$ 

If the magnitude of a force $|\vec{F}| = 12.4$ and the force acts at $\theta=110$ degrees relative to the positive x-axis, what is the x-component of the force $F_x$?

Q02.37 The distance $d$ a free-thrown projectile travels is dependent on the projectile's initial velocity $v_0$, the acceleration due to gravity $g=9.81 m/s^2$ and the angle $\theta$ at which the project is launched according to:

$$ d = \frac{{v_0}^2}{g} \sin(2\theta) $$

If a projectile is launched at a 12 degree angle with an initial velocity of 150 m/s, how far will the projectile travel?

$$ \log(87.1) + \log(210) + \log(10^{3}) $$

Q02.43 Logarithms turn exponents into multiplication. Complete both of the calculations below to see if the expressions are equal.

$$ \log(6.02 \times 10^{23}) $$

$$ (23)\log(6.02) $$

Q02.44 Python's math module has the natural log ($\ln$) function ```math.log()``` and the log (base 10) function ```math.log10()```. If you want to find the log with an arbitrary base, $b$, of a number $n$, you can use a ratio of natural logarithms (log base $e$) according to:

$$ \log_b(n) = \frac{\ln(n)}{\ln(b)} $$

$$ log_{4}(3.9 \times 10^{-9}) $$

Q02.45 The magnitude of a vector $|\vec{v}|$ is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the vector's components $v_x$, $v_y$, and $v_z$ according to:

$$ |\vec{v}| = \sqrt{{v_x}^2 + {v_y}^2 + {v_z}^2} $$

What is the magnitude of a vector $\vec{v}$ that has components $v_x = 76.3$, $v_y = 70.9$, $v_z = 93.6$ ? 

Q02.46 Moore's Law, a relationship that states the number of transistors that fit on a microchip doubles every two years can be modeled as:

$$ P_n = P_0 \times 2^n $$ 

Where $P_0$ is the original number of transistors on a microchip and $P_n$ is the number of transistors on a microchip after $n$ number of years since the original microchip.  If the original microchip has 1000 transistors, how many transistors were projected to be on a microchip 40 years later?
