## Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to use the Python REPL, also called the Python prompt, to solve calculation problems. You learned how to do arithmetic, powers and logarithms, trigonometry and save values to variables. Operations on strings were introduced including concatenation, comparison, indexing, and slicing. In the last section of the chapter, Python's ```print()``` function was introduced. As shown multiple times through this chapter, remember Python counting starts at ```0``` and ends at ```n-1```.
