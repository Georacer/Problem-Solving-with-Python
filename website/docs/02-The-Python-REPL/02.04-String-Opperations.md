## String Opperations
Some opperations we can do on strings include indexing, concatination, and logical comparisions
### Indexing
```python
>>> word = 'Solution'
>>> word[0]
'S'
```
```python
>>> word[2]
'1'
```
```python
>>> word[-1]
'n'
```
```python
>>> word[0:3]
'Sol'
```
```python
>>> word[:]
'Solution'
```
```python
>>> word[-3:-1]  #not including ending
'io'
```
```python
>>> word[0:8:2]  #start:stop+1:countby
'Slto'
```
```python
>>> word[::-1] # start=not specified :stop=not specified:step=-1
'noituloS'
```
