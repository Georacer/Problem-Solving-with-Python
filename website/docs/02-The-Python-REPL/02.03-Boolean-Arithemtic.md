## Boolean Arithemtic
_Boolean Arithmetic_ is the arithmetic of true and false logic. A _boolean_ or logical value can either be ```True``` or ```False```. In Python the key words ```True``` and ```False``` denote a boolean variable. Note that assigning ```true``` or ```false``` to a variable will produce an error.
```python
>>> A = True
>>> B = False
```

```python
>>> A
True
```

```python
>>> B
False
```

```python
>>> A or B
True
```

```python
>>> A and B
False
```

```python
>>> not A
False
```

```python
>>> not B
True
```

```python
>>> A == B
False
```

```python
>>> A != B
True
```

```python
>>> C = False
>>> A or (C and B)
True
>>> (A and B) or C

```
