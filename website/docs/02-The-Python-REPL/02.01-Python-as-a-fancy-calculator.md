## Python as a fancy calculator
Python can be used as a fancy calculator to do arithmetic like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It can also be used for trigonometric calculations and statistical calculations.
### Arithmetic

Python can be used as a calculator to make simple or complex calculations. 

We can do this easily with Python at the Python Prompt, often called the Python REPL for Read Evaluate Print Loop. The Python REPL shows three arrow symbols ```>>>``` after which you will see a blinking cursor. Programmers type commands at the prompt then hit [ENTER]. The is Read by the interperator, results of running the commands are Evaluated then Printed to the command window.  After the output a new ```>>>``` prompt appears on a new line. This process happens over and over again (in a loop). Try the following commands at the Python REPL:

Suppose the mass of a battery is 5 kg and the mass of the battery cables is 3 kg. What is the mass of the battery cable assembly?

```python
>>> 5 + 3
8
```

Suppose one of the cables above is removed and it has a mass of 1.5 kg. What is the mass of the left over assembly

```python
>>> 8 - 1.5
6.5
```

If the battery has a mass of 5000 g and a volume of 2500 $cm^3$ What is the density of the battery? The formula for density is below, where D is density, m is mass and v is volume.

$$ D = \frac{m}{v} $$

In the problem above $m = 5000$ and $v=2500$

Let's solve this with Python

```python
>>> 5000 / 2500
2.0
```

What if we have 2 batteries that each weight 5 kg? How much mass is two batteries?

```python
>>> 5 * 2
2.0
```

The dimension of the battery of each battery is 3 cm. What is the area of the base of the battery?
To do this problems, use the the double asterisk symbol ```**``` to raise a number to a power. This is similar to using $3^2$.

```python
>>> 3 ** 2
9
```

What is the volume of the battery if each the length, width and height of the battery are all 3 cm?

```python
>>> 3 ** 3
27
```

Find the mass of the two batteries, and two cables

We can use Python to find the mass of the batteries and then use the answer, which Python saves as an underscore \_ to use in our next operation. (This is similar to ans in MATLAB)

```python
>>> 2 * 5 
10
>>> _ + 1.5 + 1
12.5
```
#### Section Summary

A summary of the arithmetic operations in Python is below:


| operator | name | description | example | result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ``` + ``` | addition | adds two numbers | ```2 + 3 ``` | ```5``` |
| ``` - ``` | subtraction | subtracts two numbers | ```8 - 6 ``` | ```2``` |
| ``` - ``` | negation | negative number | ```-4``` | ```-4``` |
| ``` * ``` | multiplication | multiplies two numbers | ``` 5 * 2 ``` | ``` 10 ``` |
| ``` / ``` | division | divides two numbers | ``` 6 / 3 ``` | ``` 2 ``` |
| ``` ** ``` | exponents | raises a number to a power | ``` 10**2 ``` | ``` 100 ``` |
| ``` _ ``` | underscore | returns last saved value  | | |
### Trig: sin, cos, tan
Python as a fancy calculator is not limited to simple arithmetic. Trig functions such as sin, cos and tan are also available. 

In order to use these functions, we need to learn a new concept: importing modules. 

In python there are many functions built into the language when it starts. These include ```+``` , ```-```, ```*```, ```/``` like we saw in the previous section. However, not all functions will work right when Python starts. Say we want to find the sine of an angle. Try the following:

```python
>>> sin(60)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'sin' is not defined
```

This error is returned because we have not told python to include the sin function. The sin function is part of the _standard library_. The standard library comes with every python installation and includes many functions, but not all of these functions are available to us when we start a new python window. In order to use the sin function, we first need to import it from math _module_ which is part of the standard library. 

Importing modules and functions is easy. We use the following syntax: from _module name_ import _function name_ 

To import the ```sin()``` function from the ```math``` module try:

```python
>>> from math import sin
>>> sin(60)
-0.3048106211022167
```

Success! Multiple modules can be imported at the same time. Say we want to use a bunch of different trig functions to solve the following problem.

Angle has a value of $\pi$/6 radians. What is the sin, cos and tan of the angle?

To solve this problem we need to import the ```sin()```, ```cos()```, and ```tan()``` functions. It would also be use full to have the value of $\pi$, rather than having to write ```3.14....``` We can import all of these functions at the same time using the syntax ```from <module> import <function1>, <function2>, <function3>```. Note the commas in between the function names. 

Try:

```python
>>> from math import sin, cos, tan, pi
>>> pi
3.141592653589793
>>> pi/4
0.7853981633974483
>>> sin(pi/4)
0.7853981633974483
>>> sin(2*pi)
```


#### Section Summary

The following trig functions are part of Python's **math** module:

| trig function | name | description | example | result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ```math.pi``` | pi | mathematical constant $\pi$ | ```math.pi``` | ```3.14``` |
| ```math.sin()``` | sine | sine of an angle in radians | ```math.sin(4)``` | ```9.025``` |
| ```math.cos()``` | cosine | cosine of an angle in radians | ```cos(3.1)``` | ```400``` |
| ```math.tan()``` | tangent | tangent of an angle in radians | ``` tan(100)``` | ```2.0``` |
| ```math.asin()``` | arc sine | inverse sine, ouput in radians | ``` math.sin(4)``` | ```9.025``` |
| ```math.acos()``` | arc cosine | inverse cosine, ouput in radians | ```log(3.1)``` | ```400``` |
| ```math.atan()``` | arc tangent | inverse tangent, ouput in radians | ```atan(100)``` | ```2.0``` |
| ```math.radians()``` | radians conversion | degrees to radians | ```math.radians(90)``` | ```1.57 ``` |
| ```math.degress()``` | degree conversion | radians to degrees | ```math.degrees(2)``` | ```114.59``` |

### Exponents and Logarithms

It is easy to calculate expnents and logarithms as well. Note that these need to be imported from the **math** module just like the trig functions above. 

The following functions can be imported from the math module:

* ```log```
* ```log10```
* ```exp```
* ```e```
* ```pow(x,y)```
* ```sqrt```

Let's try a couple of examples

```python
>>> from math import log, log10, exp, e, pow, sqrt
>>> log(3.0*e**3.4)         # note: natural log
4.4986122886681095
```

A right triangle has side lengths 3 and 4. What is the length of the hypotenuse?

```python
>>> sqrt(3**2 + 4**2)
5.0 
```

The power function ```pow()``` works like the ```**``` operator to raise a number to a power.

```python
>>> 5**2
25
```

<br>

```python
>>> pow(5,2)
25.0
```

#### Section Summary

The following exponent and logarithm functions are part of the **math** module:


| math module function | name | description | example | result
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ``` math.e ``` | euler's number | mathematical constant $e$ | ``` math.e ``` | ``` 2.718 ``` |
| | | | | |
| ``` math.exp() ``` | exponent | $e$ raised to a power | ``` math.exp(2.2) ``` | ``` 9.025 ``` |
| ``` math.log() ``` | natural logerithm | log base e | ``` math.log(3.1) ``` | ``` 400 ``` |
| ``` math.log10() ``` | base 10 logerithm | log base 10 | ``` math.log10(100) ``` | ``` 2.0 ``` |
| ``` math.pow() ``` | exponents | raises a number to a power | ``` math.pow(2,3) ``` | ``` 8.0 ``` |
| ``` math.sqrt() ``` | square root | square root of a number | ``` math.sqrt(16) ``` | ``` 4.0 ``` |
### Staticstics

To round out this section, we will look at a couple of statistics functions. These functions are part of the **standard library** but not part of the **math** module. To access these statistics functions we need to import them from the **statistics** module using the statement ```from statistics import mean, median, mode, stdev```. Then the functions ```mean```, ```median```, ```mode``` and ```stdev```(standard deviation) can be used.  

```python
>>> from statistics import mean, median, mode, stdev
    
>>> test_scores = [ 60 , 83, 83, 91, 100]
    
>>> mean(test_scores)
83.4

>>> median(test_scores)
83

>>> mode(test_scores)
83
    
>>> stdev(test_scores)
14.842506526863986 
```

Alternatively, we can import the whole **statistics** module using the statement ```import statistics```. Then to use the functions, we need to use the names ```statistics.mean```, ```statistics.median```, ```statistics.mode```, and ```statistics.stdev```. See below:

```python
>>> import statistics
    
>>> test_scores = [ 60 , 83, 83, 91, 100]
    
>>> statistics.mean(test_scores)
83.4

>>> statistics.median(test_scores)
83

>>> statistics.mode(test_scores)
83
    
>>> statistics.stdev(test_scores)
14.842506526863986 
```

#### Section Summary

The following functions are part of the **statistics** module:


| statistics module function | name | description | example | result
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ``` mean() ``` | mean | mean or average | ``` mean([1,4,5,5]) ``` | ``` 3.75 ``` |
| ``` median() ``` | median | middle value | ``` median([1,4,5,5]) ``` | ``` 4.5 ``` |
| ``` mode() ``` | mode | most often | ``` mode([1,4,5,5]) ``` | ``` 5 ``` |
| ``` stdev() ``` | standard deviation | spread of data | ``` stdev([1,4,5,5]) ``` | ``` 1.892 ``` |
| ``` variance() ``` | variance | variance of data | ``` variance([1,4,5,5]) ``` | ``` 3.583 ``` |
