Q2.25 The general equation for the distance, $d$, that a free falling body travels (neglecting air resistance) is $d = \frac{1}{2}gt^2$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $t$ is the fall time. Assume the acceleration due to gravity $g = 9.81$. How far (what distance) will a ball fall in time $t = 12$?  

Q2.26 The general equation for the fall time, $t$, that a free falling body takes (neglecting air resistance) to cover a distance, $d$ is $t = \sqrt{\frac{d}{0.5g}}$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Assume the acceleration due to gravity $g = 9.81$. How long (what time) will it take a base jumper to fall distance $d = 2000$?
