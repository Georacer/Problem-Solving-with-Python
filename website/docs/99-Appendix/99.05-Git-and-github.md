## Git and github.com
**Git** is a common version control tool used by computer program developers to save code and work on code as a team. **Git** is a program run from the command line or **Anaconda Prompt**.
[github.com](https://github.com/) is a website and service used by open source projects to share code and allow other users to make changes to existing code.
Both **git** and **github.com** are useful for problemsolvers working in teams.
To use git and github the understanding of a few terms is import:

 * **git** - a command line program used to track file changes and colaborate on code with others
 * **repo** - short name for "repository". A repo is a directory that contains files and other subfolders with files
 * **local repo** -  a directory that contains files and subfolders on your computer that git knows about
 * **remote repo** - a set of files and subfolders stored in the cloud that git knows about
Useful git commands are summarized below:

| command | description |
| --- | --- |
| ```git init``` | initialize a new repository |
| ```git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git``` | links a local repo with a remote repo on github.com |
| ```git add .``` | adds all the files and changes to the local git repo |
| ```git commit -m "commit message"``` | commits the changes in the local repo |
| ```git push origin master``` | pushes the changes up to the remote repo on github.com |
| ```git pull origin master``` | pulls the version in the remote repo down to the local repo |
| ```git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git``` | copies a remote repo on github.com to a local directory |


### Cloning a repo
One common task to complete with git is to clone a repo from github.com and save it locally. This is accomplished with:

```text
$ git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

This command will copy the repo named ```repo``` from the user ```user```. To clone the repo for this book, use:

```text
$ git clone https:github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/Problem-Solving-with-Python.git
```

### Creating a synching a remote repo on github.com with a local repo
Another common task to complete with git is to synch a remote repo with github.com with a local repo on any one of your computers. This is useful for one person if they want to keep the files in a particular project synched. It is also useful for a group of problem solvers who are working on the same project to have access to the same remote repo on github.com and then have the same local repo on all of their computers.

First, go to github.com and create a new account. Log on and create a new repo. It is a good idea to include a license and a .gitignore file. For a Python project, the .gitignore file for Python is a good start. 

Second, create a local directory and ```cd``` into it. Initialize a git repo locally in that directory then synch the local folder with the remote repo on github.com.

```text
$ mkdir newproject
$ cd newproject
$ git init
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
$ git pull origin master
```

Third, work on the project locally. For example, you could edit one of the files or create a new file.

Finally, save your work and commit the changes you made with git. Push those changes up to the remote repo on github.com

```text
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "commit message"
$ git push origin master
```
