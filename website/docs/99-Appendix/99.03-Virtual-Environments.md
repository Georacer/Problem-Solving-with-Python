## Virtual Environments
Using _virtual environments_ is standard practice in Python. A virtual environment is an isolated installation of Python with associated packages. When you use virtual environments, one project can have a separate version of Python and packages. Another project can use a different virtual environment and therefore have a separate version of Python and packages. By utilizing virtual environments, two projects on the same computer can use different versions of Python and different versions of packages.
### Create a virtual environment with the Anaconda Prompt

To create the new virtual environment, open the **Anaconda Prompt** and issue the command:

```text
> conda create --name env_name python=3.6
```

The ```conda create``` command builds the new virtual environment. The ```--name env_name``` flag gives the new virtual environment the name ```env_name```.  Including ```python=3.6``` ensures the virtual environment has a current version of Python. 

The following output or something similar results:

```text
The following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:

    ca-certificates: 2018.03.07-0           
    certifi:         2018.11.29-py36_0      
    libedit:         3.1.20170329-h6b74fdf_2
    libffi:          3.2.1-hd88cf55_4       
    libgcc-ng:       8.2.0-hdf63c60_1       
    libstdcxx-ng:    8.2.0-hdf63c60_1       
    ncurses:         6.1-he6710b0_1         
    openssl:         1.1.1a-h7b6447c_0      
    pip:             18.1-py36_0            
    python:          3.6.8-h0371630_0       
    readline:        7.0-h7b6447c_5         
    setuptools:      40.6.3-py36_0          
    sqlite:          3.26.0-h7b6447c_0      
    tk:              8.6.8-hbc83047_0       
    wheel:           0.32.3-py36_0          
    xz:              5.2.4-h14c3975_4       
    zlib:            1.2.11-h7b6447c_3      

Proceed ([y]/n)?
```

Type ```y``` to confirm and create the new virtual environment. 
### Activate a virtual environment

To use the new virtual environment ```env_name```, it first needs to be activated:

```text
> conda activate env_name
```

The virtual environment is active when you see ```(env_name) >``` in parenthesis at the start of the prompt:

```text
(env_name) > 
```
### Install packages in a virtual environment

When a new virtual environment is created, no packages are installed by default. If you use the Anaconda distribution of Python, the ```base``` environment contains about 600 packages that come with Anaconda. But a fresh new virtual environment will just have Python installed, no other packages.

To install a package into the virtual environment ```(env_name)```, first, make sure the environment is active (```(env_name)``` before the prompt). Package installation is accomplished with the ```conda install``` command followed by the package name. To install Matplotlib into the virtual environment type:

```text
(env_name) > conda install matplotlib
```

Multiple packages can be installed with the same command. To install both NumPy and Jupyter use:

```text
(env_name) > conda install numpy jupyter
```
### Deactivate a virtual environment

To deactivate an active environment, use:

```text
(env_name) > conda deactivate
>
```

When the virtual environment is deactivated, the prompt looks normal ```>```, with no environment name in parenthesis before it.
### List your virtual environments

View a list of your virtual environments using the command ```conda info --envs``` or ```conda env list```.

```text
> conda activate env_name
(env_name) > conda info --envs

# conda environments:
#
base                     /home/tribilium/anaconda3
env_name               * /home/tribilium/anaconda3/envs/env_name
matplotlib               /home/tribilium/anaconda3/envs/matplotlib
```

Notice the ``` * ``` asterisk on the line with ```env_name```. The virtual environment with the ``` * ``` is currently active. 

To exit the virtual environment, use the command ``` conda deactivate```. 

```text
(env_name) > conda deactive
```

If you run ```conda env list``` again, there is no ```*``` in front of ```env_name```. That's because the ```env_name``` virtual environment is no longer active.

```text
> conda env list

# conda environments:
#
base                  *  /home/tribilium/anaconda3
env_name                 /home/tribilium/anaconda3/envs/env_name
matplotlib               /home/tribilium/anaconda3/envs/matplotlib

```
### Remove a virtual environment

Remove a virtual environment with the command ```conda remove --name env_name --all```. Exit out of the environment to want to remove before you remove it.

Check to see if the virtual environment you want to remove is present:

```text
> conda env list

# conda environments:
#
base                  *  /home/tribilium/anaconda3
env_name                 /home/tribilium/anaconda3/envs/env_name
matplotlib               /home/tribilium/anaconda3/envs/matplotlib

```

Remove the virtual environment called ```env_name```.

```text
> conda remove --name env_name --all

Proceed ([y]/n)?
```

Type [y] to remove the environment. View a list of your virtual environments again. Note that ```env_name```is no longer in the list.

```text
> conda env list

# conda environments:
#
base                  *  /home/tribilium/anaconda3
matplotlib               /home/tribilium/anaconda3/envs/matplotlib
