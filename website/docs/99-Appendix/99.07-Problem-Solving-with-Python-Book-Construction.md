## Problem Solving with Python Book Construction
### Jupyter Notebooks
This book was constructed using **jupyter notebooks**. The GitHub repo for the books can be found at:
    
[https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/Problem-Solving-with-Python](https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/Problem-Solving-with-Python)
The directory structure of the github repo contains all the **jupyter notebooks** used the write the book. The repo also contains a set of custom conversion scripts and templates which convert the jupyuter notebooks into **_.html_** and **_.tex_** files.

The notebooks directory contains a directory for each chapter of the book:
```
notebooks/
|-- 00-Preface/
|-- 01-Orientation/
|-- 02-The-Python-REPL/
|-- 03-Data-Types-and-Variables/
|-- 04-Jupyter-Notebooks/
|-- 05-Functions-and-Modules/
|-- 06-Plotting-with-Matplotlib/
|-- 07-If-Else-Try-Except/
|-- 08-Loops/

|-- 11-Python-and-External-Hardware/
|-- 12-MicroPython/
|-- 99-Appendix/

`-- TOC.ipynb
```
Within each chapter directory, there is a **jupyter notebook** for each section, and an images directory for any images used in the markdown sections of the notebooks.

### Website
The website for the book was constructed using **mkdocs** and the **Material for MkDocs** theme. Jupyter noteboks were exported to **_.html_** files with markdown cells unformatted. 
### Hardcopy
The hard copy of the book was constructed using **LateX**, **nbconvert** and a set of custom scripts and templates. One conversion script combined all of the notebooks into one BIG notebook.  This BIG notebook was then converted into **LaTeX** using **nbconvert** and a custom template. Outside of the Python ecosystem, a separate installation of TeXworks compiled the LaTeX **_.tex_** to **_.pdf_**.
