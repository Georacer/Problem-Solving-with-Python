## LaTeX Math
LaTeX math can be included in Jupyter notebook markdown cells. LaTeX math can also be included in parts of **matplotlib plots** like axis labels and text fields. 

Inline LaTeX math commands need to be enclosed by the dollar signs.

```text
angle is $2\pi$ radians
```

The markup above will be rendered as:

angle is $2\pi$ radians

A table of useful LaTeX commands and the associated output is below:
