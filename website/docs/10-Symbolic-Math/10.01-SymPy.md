## SymPy
SymPy [http://www.sympy.org](http://www.sympy.org) is a Python library for __symbolic math__.  

Symbolic Math is using symbols to represent mathematical expressions. An example symbolic math expression is below:
$$ x^{2} + y^{2} = z $$
In the expression, we have the variables $x$, $y$ and $z$. 
If we define a second symbolic math expression as:
$$ x = a + b $$
then we can substitue in $a + b$ for $x$.
This would result in the expression:
$$ (a + b)^{2} + y^{2} = z $$

$$ a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2} + y^{2} = z $$
Now to solve for $y$ in terms of $a$,$b$ and $z$, would result in:
    
$$ y = \sqrt{z - a^{2} - 2ab - b^{2}} $$
If we have numerical values for $z$, $a$ and $b$, we can use Python to calculate the value of $y$. But if we don't have numberical values for $z$, $a$ and $b$ Python can also be used to rearrange terms and solve for one variable in terms of the other. Working with mathemtical symbols in a programatic way instead of working with numerical values in a programatic way is call symbolic math.
To work with symbolic math, the **SymPy** library needs to be installed. Using the **Anaconda Prompt** this can be accomplished with the command:

```bash
$ conda install sympy
```
Sympy is included with the Anaconda distribution of Python, so if you have the full Anaconda distrobution, you will be notified that the **Sympy** library is already installed.
