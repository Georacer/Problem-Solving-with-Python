## Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to create plots using Python and Matplotlib. You learned what Matplotlib is and why problem solvers should learn how to use Matplotlib. Matplotlib installation was shown at the start of the chapter. Then, you learned how to build line plots and save plots as image files. You learned how to customize plots by including axis label, titles, and legends on your plots. You also learned how to add annotations to plots.

Types of charts detailed in this chapter:

 * line plots
 
 * multi-line plots
 
 * bar graphs
 
 * pie charts
 
 * bar and line graphs with error bars
 
 * scatter plots
 
 * histograms
 
 * box plots and violin plots
 
 * contour plots
 
 * quiver plots
 
 * stream plots
 
 * 3D surface plots
 
 * 3D wire frame plots
 
 * 3D surface plots with projections
