## Strings
Another built-in Python data type is _strings_. Strings are sequences of letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. In Python, strings can be almost any length and can contain spaces. String variables are assigned in Python using quotation marks ```'   '``` or ```" "```. In Python, strings can be defined by single quotation marks ```' '``` or double quotation marks ```" "```. 

Python strings can contain blank spaces. A blank space is a valid character in Python string.

```python
>>> string = 'z'
>>>> type(string)
<class 'str'>

>>> string = 'Engineers'
>>> type(string)
<class 'str'>
```

The output ```<class 'str'>``` indicates the variable is a string.
### Numbers as Strings

Numbers and decimals can be defined as strings too. If a decimal number is defined using quotes ```'   '```, the number is saved as a string rather than as a float. Integers defined using quotes will become strings as well if surrounded by quotes.

```python
>>> num = '5.2'
>>> type(num)
<class 'str'>

>>> num = '2'
>>> type(num)
<class 'str'>
```
### Strings as Boolean Values

Strings can be converted to boolean values (converted to True or False). The empty string ```""``` returns as ```False```. All other strings convert to ```True```. 

```python
>>> name = "Gabby"
>>> bool(name)
True
```

```python
>>> empty = ""
>>> bool(empty)
False
```

Note that a string which contains just one space (```" "```) is not empty. It contains the space character. Therefore a string made up of just one space converts to ```True```.

```python
>>> space = " "
>>> bool(space)
True
```
