## Strings
Strings are sequences of letters, numbers, spaces and symbols. In Python, strings can be almost any length and can contain spaces. String variables are assigned in Python using quotation marks ```'   '```. Strings can contain blank spaces. A blank space is a valid string character in Python.

```python
>>> string = 'z'
>>>> type(string)
<class 'str'>

>>> string = 'Engineers'
>>> type(string)
<class 'str'>
```
### Numbers as Strings

Numbers and decimals can be defined as strings too. If a decimal number is defined using quotes ```'   '```, it will be saved as a string rather than as a float. Integers defined using quotes will become strings as well if surrounded with quotes.

```python
>>> num = '5.2'
>>> type(num)
<class 'str'>

>>> num = '2'
>>> type(num)
<class 'str'>
```
