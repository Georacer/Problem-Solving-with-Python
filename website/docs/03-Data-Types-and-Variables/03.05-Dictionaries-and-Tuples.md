## Dictionaries and Tuples
Besides lists, Python has two additional data structures that can store multiple objects. These are __dictionaries__ and __tuples__.
### Dictionaries
Dictionaries are made up of key: value pairs
### Tuples
Tuples are immutable lists. Elements of a list can be modified, but elements in a tuple can only be accessed, not modified. The name tuple does not mean that only two values can be stored.
