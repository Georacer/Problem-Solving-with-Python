    "So far in this text, all of the Python code has either been written purely linearly or be linear and include functions. A strictly linear program is one that runs top to bottom, and every line of code in the program is run. In a linear program with functions, the program still runs head to base, but the program takes a side excursion to execute functions on the way down. \n",

    "If this next couple chapters, you will begin to write programs non-linearly. Non-linear programs do not just run every line of code top to bottom. In a non-linear program, sections of code may not be run based on a selection statement like _if_ or _try_. Another way to have a non-linear program is to include loops, sections of code that run multiple times, with repetition structures like _for loops_ and _while loops_. \n",
