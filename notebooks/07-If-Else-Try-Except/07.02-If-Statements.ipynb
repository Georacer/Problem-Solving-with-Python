A logical condition is an expression that can be evaluated as ```True``` or ```False```. An example of logical condition is ```a<5```. This logical condition will return ```True``` if ```a``` is less than 5. Otherwise if ```a``` is 5 or greater it will return ```False```. Following the logical condition, a colon ```:``` is needed. After the if statement, a chunk of code to run when the condition is ```True``` is included. The section of code must be indented and indendented the same amount. By convention this is 4 spaces. Most Python code editors, including Jupyter Notebooks will indent code after an if statement automatically. \n",
