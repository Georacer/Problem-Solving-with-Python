    "Below are the recommended ways to install a new version of Python from Python.org on the three major operating systems: Windows, MacOS and Linux. This book is based on Python version 3.6.  Some of the problems may not work properly on legacy Python (version 2.7).  I recommend using the Anaconda Distribution of Python on Windows and MacOSX. The installation of Anaconda on these operating systems was detailed in previous sections."
