    "When Python shows the variable ```ustring``` is of ```<class 'str'>```, it indicates ```ustring``` is a _unicode string_. **In Python 3 all strings are _unicode strings_ by defaut**. _Unicode Strings_ are useful because there are many letter and letter-like characters that are not part of the the set of letters, numbers and symbols on a regular computer keyboard.  For instance, English is not the most widely spoken language on the planet. In Spanish, the accent character is used over certain vowels. Letters with accents can't be represented by the letters on a standard keyboard.  However those accent letters are part of a set of letters, numbers and symbols in _unicode strings_."

    "Another way that characters such as letters, numbers and punctuation can be stored is as _bytes_. A _byte_ is a unit of computer information that has a fixed width (one byte long). Because of this fixed width, one _byte_ only has a small number of unique combinations. This limits _byte strings_ to basically only the letter, numbers and punctuation marks on a computer keyboard. This limited set of characters are called ASCII (pronounced _ask-ee two_) characters. A table of ASCII character codes is in the appendix. For instantance, ASCII code ```49``` corresponds to the number one ```1```. **Python does not use _byte strings_ by default**. But external hardware such as Arduinos, oscilloscopes, and voltmeters speak _byte strings_ by default. In fact almost all machines speak _byte strings_ by default including the servers that bring Netflix to your laptop. "
