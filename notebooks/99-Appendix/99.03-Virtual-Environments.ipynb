    "Using _virtual environments_ is standard practice in Python. A virtual environment is an isolated installation of Python with associated packages. When you use virtual environments, one project can have a separate version of Python and packages. Another project can use a different virtual environment and therefore have a separate version of Python and packages. By utilizing virtual environments, two projects on the same computer can use different versions of Python and different versions of packages."
