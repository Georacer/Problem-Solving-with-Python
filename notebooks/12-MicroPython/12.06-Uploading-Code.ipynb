    "Now write the Python code that will be put on the board. The Feather Huzzah board has two main Python files: **boot.py** and **main.py**. Additional files can also be added to the board. **boot.py** is the file that runs first when the board is powered up. After **boot.py** runs, then **main.py** will run. Another **.py** file can be added to the board to provide **main.py** with some functions and classes to work with. \n",

    "Two general things need to be accomplished on the Feather Huzzah board to turn it into a WiFi weather station: read the temperature and post the temperature to ThingSpeak.com. Two different **.py** files will be constructed, one **.py** file for each of these general functionalities (reading the temperature and posting the temperature). \n",
    "\n",
    "The first **MCP9808.py** file will simplify reading temperature data off of the Adafruit MCP9808 temperature breakout. A function that parses out the temperature data from the I2C bus and return it as the output for the **readtemp** function will be created. The function needs to import the ```machine``` module to use the I2C bus. The machine module provides the class to create a new i2c object. When the i2c object is instantiated, the ```scl``` and ```sda``` pins that the sensor is connected to need to be specified. ```scl``` is the i2c clock line and ```sda``` is the i2c data line. These are pins 5 and 4 on the Adafruit Feather Huzzah. Then a new byte array variable needs to be created, so that later data from the sensor can be saved into it.  Next read the sensor data using the ```i2c.readfrom_mem_into()``` function. The first argument is the I2C bus address for the sensor. In this case the sensor is at I2C bus address ```24```. The line ```>>> i2c.scan()``` typed into the micropython REPL will show the I2C bus address.  The next function argument is the register on the MCP9808 temperature sensor where the temperature value is stored, which happens to be register ```5```. If register ```5``` is accessed on the MCP, the temperature can be recorded. The third arguments is the variable to store the temperature data into. The ```i2c.readfrom_mem_into()``` method changes the variable that is a method argument, rather than changing a variable which is the method output as most methods do. This is why the ```byte_data``` variable needs to be created before calling the ```i2c.readfrom_mem_into()``` method. Next some post processing is needed to convert the byte array into a temperature in degrees C.\n",
